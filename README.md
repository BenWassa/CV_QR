Notes and recommendations:

- The **blob** links (the `github.com/.../blob/...` URLs) show the GitHub preview page. The **raw** URLs (`raw.githubusercontent.com/...`) point to the PDF file bytes and are what you should use for QR codes.
- Most mobile browsers will open PDFs in-browser when visiting the raw URL. For an automatic forced-download behavior you would need to host the file on a server that sends `Content-Disposition: attachment` or create a small HTML download wrapper hosted on the same origin (e.g., via GitHub Pages) that triggers download.
- If you want, I can add the QR PNG files to this repo directly (generated and committed), or create a simple HTML landing page for each CV that forces download via a download link — tell me which you prefer.
